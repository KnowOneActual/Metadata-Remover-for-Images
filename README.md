# 🖼️ Metadata Remover for Images

Welcome to the **Metadata Remover for Images**! This Python script helps you easily strip metadata from your image files, ensuring your privacy when sharing photos online. 

## 🚀 Features
- **Process Single Image**: Remove metadata from a specified image file.
- **User-Friendly Input**: Prompt the user for the file paths.
- **File Extension Validation**: Ensures the output file has a valid image extension.

## 📜 How It Works
This script utilizes the **Pillow** library to handle image processing. When you run the script, you will be prompted to enter:
1. The path to the image file you want to process.
2. The path where you want to save the new image without metadata.

The script will then save a new version of the image, free from any extraneous metadata.

## 📦 Requirements
Make sure you have the Pillow library installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## 🛠️ Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script using Python.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the input and output file paths.
4. Enjoy your clean image without metadata!

## 🎉 Example
```bash
python metadata_remover.py
```
```
Enter the path to the image file: /path/to/your/photo.jpg
Enter the path to save the image without metadata: /path/to/your/photo_no_metadata.jpg
```

## 🤔 Why Remove Metadata?
Metadata can contain sensitive information such as location data, camera settings, and other details about your image. By removing it, you can safeguard your privacy and control what information you share.
